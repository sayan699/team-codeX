        The vision of city is evolved after series of discussions with citizens, stakeholders & elected representatives overlaid on the detailed study of SWOT analysis of the city. The vision was structured to address the weakness of the city and taking its strengths to the next step. <br><br>Chennai city has been selected as one of the cities to become a member of 100 Resilience Cities pioneered by Rockfeller Foundation, USA. By this Chennai will  become a more Resilent city by exchange of innovative resilience strategy among other 99 Resilence cities.

        A universal cultural hub for safe and sustainable living with enhanced mobility, smart urban infrastructure and become more resilient to the physical, social, and economic challenges.

        <br>
        Infrastructure development has been a key driving force to Chennai’s growth and has been critical in attracting corporate and individuals alike.<br> Chennai’s infrastructure is under constant strain. Traffic bottlenecks, restricted civic amenities and high pollution are all characteristics of this strain on infrastructure. However, over the past several years, a number of initiatives aimed at improving connectivity have been undertaken to ease some of this burden. <br><br>The major initiative is the Metro Rail Network, consisting of three corridors. The metro stations are the gateway to smaller areas/ neighborhoods within the city        </div>

          <h3 class="text-center text-primary">What is smart city:</h3>
          <br>
The first question is what is meant by a ‘smart city’.<br> The answer is, there is no universally accepted definition of a smart city. It means different things to different people. <br>
The conceptualisation of Smart City, therefore, varies from city to city and country to country, depending on the level of development, willingness to change and reform, resources and aspirations of the city residents.<br><br> A smart city would have a different connotation in India than, say, Europe. Even in India, there is no one way of defining a smart city.
